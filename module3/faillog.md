My first fun learning experience this week was [this](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module3/faillog/june3.PNG). I caused an error that I couldn't figure out how to get out of at first. My workaround was to refresh the browser, which destroyed my work history every time it happened. Eventually i remembered that ctrl+c is a thing, and it worked to fix the problem. Unfortunately my hisotry for the week suffered greatly.

I also had a fun time with using Regex to clean up the letters list. I thought it was super cool, until I forgot to put a space when change "to" to a comma. [This](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module3/faillog/oops.PNG) was the result. I tried to fix it, and [somehow made it worse](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module3/faillog/WHOOOPS.PNG). In the end I went back a few steps to get a clean version. I learned to back things up before I make big changes!

The biggest struggle for me with the capstone exercise was that I couldn't figure out how to delete random characters like brackets and quotation marks. When I did, it caused an [error](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module3/faillog/cleaning%20up%20war%20diary.PNG). I'm going to look into this soon to try and figure out how to get around it.
