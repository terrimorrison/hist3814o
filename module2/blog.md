I didn’t know that datum was the singular form of data. Today I learned, lol.

I found working with DH Box to write the blurb for exercise 1 to be frustrating. I decided I wanted to link things and then realized I would need to move the links around to do so. I tried regularly copy and pasting, which didn’t work because ctrl+x does something else in nano, so I then used ctrl+k and was very confused about why entire lines were disappearing. Once I figured out that this command would take the entire line out, I was able to do what I wanted to do. Having to use the arrow buttons to move the cursor was probably the most frustrating aspect of this. 

While using DH Box to download a lot of stuff from Active History was pretty cool, I couldn’t figure out how to escape it. For some reason everytime I typed something, DH Box would spit out more wget stuff at me and I was incredibly confused. I asked my brother and he said ctrl+c was how to kill commands, so I did that and was finally able to escape the generated text mess I was making. I don’t have any clue what I did to get that to happen, or what it did to my files. After that, downloading the history of that was a struggle. I didn’t realize that what I would download would be in the active history folder I made, so I made a bunch of copies that get more and more confusing as you go through, because for some reason it wouldn’t show me what I was typing anymore which resulted in random letters being typed. 

So all in all, had a great time. A super great time. 

I like that we’re being respectful when we’re downloading things. I probably wouldn’t have thought too much about it if it wasn’t pointed out in the exercises. 

For exercise 3, I originally got everything to work properly with the exception of the formatting (for some reason it highlights the whole paragraph, not just the word). When I tried to fix that, I guess I broke it?. Now the document won’t even load. So that’s frustrating. Okay, scratch that. It’s showing up now, but my original problem with paragraph is still an issue. I don’t what the issue is with this?

I’m confused about what’s going on in exercise 4. It went completely over my head. I still went through it, but I honestly have no idea what I was doing at all. 

In exercise 5, I originally struggled to do anything outside of the tutorial, but I was eventually able to make word clouds for @dril and @realDonaldTrump. 

For exercise 6 I was having a pretty good time until I got to the part with progressively converting the files. That’s when I realized my folder wasn’t “ocr-test” but “orc-test.” That was amusing. Once I figured it out, everything worked fine. 

There was a lot going on in this module. I had a lot of fun with exercise 5, but a lot of the exercises were a bit of a struggle. My faillog is looking a bit empty this week, and I think it’s because I was so busy being flustered by everything not working right away that I didn’t keep track of what was going on. I’ll try to do a better job of that next week. 

# Reading Response

I’m going into my fourth year at Carleton, and I have yet to talk to a librarian. I’m not actually sure where to even find a librarian, because the students definitely don’t count. Last summer was the first time I had to check out a book, which I didn’t actually know how to do until then. Before that, I had managed to get by with only using online sources. 

It’s probably a weird product of growing up in this time that I don’t know how to find a librarian, but I do know how to conduct research by myself online. I find it unfortunate, because I know that librarians receive a lot of training and are incredible resources that I’m not using. 

When I was reading Ted Underwood’s 'Theorizing Research Practices We Forgot to Theorize Twenty Years Ago', I couldn’t help but think of how I’ve become too accustomed to using search engines. I worry that I’ve fallen victim to confirmation bias on all the essays that I’ve just searched for sources for online. Utilizing resources like libraries and librarians would be a great way to start getting away from that. I found when I used the (physical) library to do my research, I was browsing by topic, rather than keywords. Going forward, I’ll have to consider using this tactic when it comes to essays. 

This week, I’ve thought a lot about how awful it would be to not have the internet when doing research. The closest I’ve come to this was over the previous semester, while doing a co-op term with Veterans Affairs. We worked with secret documents that couldn’t be transmitted over regular networks, and so when someone needed secret documents, they needed to be delivered by hand. Usually, that was my job. I had to walk documents to places all over downtown, take taxis to Gatineau, and once I helped my coworker mail a USB to Prince Edward Island. I can only imagine how stressful and how much work it would be to do research without keyword searches. 

So while they’re definitely somewhat flawed (due to us not really understanding them, mostly) I think I’ll stick with searching for most of my sources online. It’s too convenient. Kinda too convenient.
