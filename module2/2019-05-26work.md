# Things I Searched

I searched for my [last name](https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=morrison) in the CWGC website and found lots of dead people. From here, I searched through civilian casualties and found [Margaret Morrison](https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/3100092/morrison,-margaret-jean/) who died at the age of two. 

I saved my search results into a Excel spreadsheet which I've uploaded here in Github. 

I really just wanted to see pictures for the epigraphic database, so I searched by places. I randomly picked [Lusitania](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/foto/suche?f_nr=&provinz=Lus&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern=&aufbewahrung=&vorlage=&aufnahme_jahr=&qualitaet=&cil=&ae=&andere=&kommentar=&hd_nr=&sort=f_nr&anzahl=20) 

I liked [this dude's](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/foto/F003511#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&r=0&xywh=120%2C124%2C859%2C673) face. 

And I also liked [this picture](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/foto/F002262#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&r=0&xywh=251%2C47%2C1283%2C1004) of a thing found in modern day Portugal because of the decorations.
