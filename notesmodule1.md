> *Remember* In module 1 and here on out, your blog post/narrative has to deal with *two* separate though related things: a reflection on the exercises, and a reflection on the readings. You can achieve this through two separate documents, or you can mix it all up into a single document. But there needs to be that recognition of *both* the readings *and* the exercises.  The faillog remember is the scratch pad, the record of commands, code you’ve written, memos-to-self of websites you’ve gone to for help, etc. It is a separate document from the blog/narrative/reflection thing.

Does Dillinger.io only work if you have the VPN on or was that just a coincidence?

Wow DH Box also hates me. I’m such a big fan.

This is a mess because I'm tired and confused.
