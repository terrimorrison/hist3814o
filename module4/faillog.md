This was a week of fails! But that's okay!

# 1
I started off with having a rough time with Gephi. I got [this](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module4/gephi%20issue%201.PNG) issue right from the beginning, which leads me to believe there was a problem with my file, however I am not sure what that issue is. I tried to push through it, and my file ended up looking like [this](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module4/gephi%20issue%202.PNG) where the data wasn't in columns like it should have been. I then tried following the tutorial and fixing my document to match, but it didn't seem to help at all. So I was frustrated that this wasn't working for me like I was hoping. 

# 2
Exercise 3 was a bit of bummer, because it started off perfectly fine and then [stopped working.](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module4/issue%20with%20Rstudio.PNG) I got an error, and I'm not entirely sure what exactly was going on, but it seems like I wasn't the only one who had problems with it based on the Slack converstation about it. 

# 3
I struggled with Map Warper at first, because [my map](https://github.com/terrimorrison/hist3814o/blob/master/module4/Map.PNG) wouldn't load. I eventually got around this error by putting up another map, and was able to set things up from there. So less of a fail, which made me happy. 

******

I spent a lot of time being frustrated this week by how things were not working out, but in the end I think I got enough working correctly for me to get a good idea of what was going on. The exercises that worked perfectly were super cool, and the ones that didn't work perfectly were still very cool and I'm glad I got to learn about them.
