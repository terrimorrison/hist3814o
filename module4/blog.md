Since there were so many exercises this week, I put more focus on the ones that were interesting to me. 

I was off to a bad start with exercise 1. Gephi didn’t want to cooperate with me at all, and I’m not sure if it’s because my file was messed up? 

Exercise 2 didn’t seem to be going too well either. For some reason the java file was corrupted and while the solution was easily replacing the file, and wow did it take me a while to get to that conclusion. In the end it worked and I thought it was pretty neat. I thought it was interesting that it showed the amount of the document that was dedicated to a certain topic. 

Exercise 3 was kind of like magic. I was copy and pasting the code from the workbook, and nothing really seemed to be happening except the console spitting back the code, so I didn’t think anything was happening until the graph finally popped up. I was so surprised. I keep expecting things in this class to not work, or to be more complicated than the instructions make them out to be, and when things work exactly like they’re supposed to, it just feels like magic to me. 

I started getting errors in exercise 3 so I gave up on it, and according to the Slack chat I wasn’t the only one having that issue, but by the time I saw the resolution it was too late in the evening to go back to it and try to fix my problem. 

The trees that could be created with Overview in exercise 4 were neat. And I’m also always a fan of word clouds. I thought Voyant was interesting as well, especially since it seems to combine Overview with Antconc in some ways. The second step of the Voyant exercise didn’t work for me, so I wasn’t able to see the difference between the two documents because it wouldn’t load the link from the workbook. But I did find the difference in the word cloud to be interesting once the stop words were taken out.

I received an error with Map Warper in that it refused to load my image. It loaded the preview image, but not the actual image that I needed to do the activity. I tried uploading it again, but it still wouldn’t load and I’m not sure what the issue is. I even looked at it on my phone and it didn’t work. I eventually uploaded another image and got that to load and started the exercise. I mostly enjoyed looking at the old maps of places I know. 

I also had a lot of trouble with exercise 10. Nothing was working properly, and I was frustrated enough that I couldn’t give the time to fix it. I thought that it looked really neat, but not something that I’d likely use going forward so I didn’t take it as too much of a loss.

It was interesting to see the overlap between the exercises and the programs that we used. I found that the ones that used text/corpus analysis were similar in their functions, but they each had their own focuses that made them unique and helpful. I was also happy to see that there were so many free programs available. This makes it easy for students to access these tools, which a paywall would definitely be a barrier for otherwise. 

I had a lot of problems this week, but I still think I learned a lot and got to experience a lot of cool new programs. I especially learned from the failures, and managed to fix a few, which I think is really important learning. Probably even more important than just following the tutorial with no issues. I also think that just being aware of these programs will be helpful in the future as well. If I see a situation where I think something we learned this week will come in handy, I can refer back to everything, and hopefully be able to work through my problems. 



# Reading Blog

I found the reading I did this week helpful for understanding the exercises. I focused on reading Michelle Moravec, and I found the article helpful for understanding what exactly was going on in Antconc. 

I thought the reading question posed at the end of the module was an interesting question. It seems to me that there’s a lot of benefits to the programs that we studied this module. Everything we did involved free programs that are aimed at finding knowledge and transforming the findings into visuals to help understand exactly what we have found. This makes the programs accessible, and therefore, the knowledge that comes from it. To me, I don’t see a downside to this. 

I see all this as a good thing because by itself, knowledge isn’t bad. People can use it for bad things, but this is about better access and understanding of the knowledge. 

Someone posted an annotation wondering if these sorts of tools would eventually mean less work for historians, which I don’t think will be true. I think it will invent new ways for history to be analyzed over time, and will change how historians do their work, but not take away from the field, except for in time spent searching texts. 

So I think historians will absolutely benefit from the route that digital history is taking. As someone who is young and grew up surrounded by technology, I have a hard time ever seeing it as a bad thing. Maybe traditionalists will have a harder time coping with the new ways, maybe someone is using these new technologies and the knowledge they help us find for malicious purposes. Maybe someone is spamming someone’s server to download a corpus. Maybe there are paid services out there that are frustrated with free services that we’re using. 

But I don’t see the technology itself as hurting anyone. Maybe I’m missing something.
