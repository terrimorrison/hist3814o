# Blog and Thoughts for Week 1

I laughed a little bit when I realized DH Box was Linux based. My brother is a huge Linux nerd and tried to convert me when I was younger, but I managed to delete the start bar and disable the mouse (thank God for keyboard shortcuts) which left him flabbergasted and then he gave up on me. So I’m a bit concerned about how I’m going to handle this. (I just showed my brother DH Box and he called it “old as beans.”)

I was really confused about the purpose of the $ in the command line prompts, but I figured it was meant to designate the prompts. This was confirmed when I opened my eyes and actually read what was in the workbook. You can see in my todayscommands thing that I copy and pasted the whole command with the $ in it the first time because I wasn’t sure. 

I was also confused by downloading the file. I don’t know where I expected the file to show up, but nothing seemed to happen and I assumed I did it wrong, so I tried again. Nothing happened. Then, the smart part of me decided to reread the instructions, and in doing so, I realized I had to go to the file manager to see the file I just downloaded. Like, makes sense. I’m not sure why I didn’t think to, like, finish the instructions, but I didn’t. So I can confirm that about 99% of my problems are that I’m horrible at following instructions. At the end of the module when I was trying to save the file as html I referred back to the instructions again, but I was confused about where the file actually was until I looked into the folder under my name and say it there. I was very proud when I managed to open my file as html!!

When I was using Nano I had the workbook on one side of my laptop screen and DH Box on the other, and when I typed my little blurb, it appeared like “But I’m d$.” So I briefly thought I broke it until I maximized the screen. DH Box doesn’t like being split screened, I guess. 

I had a lot easier of a time with exercise 3. I had already played with Github a bit last week, so I was fairly comfortable. I didn’t struggle at all with this portion, even though I’m not entirely comfortable with Github yet. I was able to get this bit done quickly. 

I got confused in the third part of exercise 4. I’m somewhat proud that I made it that far. DH Box blows my mind. I am just not able to comprehend how to learn how to do this sort of stuff (I understand realistically it’s practice and what not but that’s not my point) because you just start with a blank black screen, type seemingly random things and get cryptic responses and you just… go from there. That being said, I thought the lessons was pretty straight forward until I got stuck. I plan on going back to it once I get some sleep and time to rest my eyes.

So this week I learned that I need to actually pay attention to the instructions. I know that I tend to learn by figuring things out by myself through trial and error, but I need to also learn to follow the instructions first, because they know better than I do. I felt really out of my element when it came to DH Box, so it would have been helpful to have followed the instructions closely before fumbling around and trying to figure it out by myself. It would have saved me time and stress for sure. 

(I tried to make another folder for my module 1 stuff, but it didn’t work. I’ll hopefully figure that out for next week otherwise things will get confusing. I also didn't have one document for my fail log because I made a folder with all of the fun stuff in it, but this also kind of covers my process so I hope that's okay? If not I can do whatever next week. Exercise 1 said not to upload anything? So I haven't but I am worried I misunderstood that.)




# Reading Reflection:

I thought the readings this week were interesting! Reading academic articles online as opposed to physical books was an interesting experience. Hyperlinks change the reading experience, and how the authors write. 

Before starting this class I hadn’t thought too much about how sharing the progress of our research might change how research is done. However, I have thought a lot about how more sources need to be digitized so that more people can have access to it. I think it’s great that I can access sources online through the MacOdrum library and download them straight to my computer, but I find it frustrating that not everything is available online, and only in print in the library. I don’t want to go outside. But if I had to, it wouldn’t be too difficult for me to do so. 

Milligan’s blog “SSHRC’s Research Data Archiving Policy and Historians” blew my mind when he mentioned that people get flown out to Ottawa from around Canada to get copies of data. It seems so counterproductive to me, so I guess Milligan and I are on the same page about sharing knowledge. He wrote at one point, “it’s our data, we collected it, and if somebody else wants the data, they should collect it themselves (9)”. I totally understand that mentality. In grade school we’re taught to do our own work, and if we help each other, it can be considered cheating. But once you get to the point that you’re doing research with the intent to publish, to me it comes across as selfish to hoard your knowledge. The whole point behind publishing is to share knowledge, so what is the point of trying to keep some to yourself?

McDaniel makes a good point about that, though. He wrote, “Two questions may arise: What if someone ‘scoops’ an idea before it can be published? And what if a publisher won’t publish articles whose data and sources are already so open and available?”  (I wrote an annotation on it). I considered the idea of someone “scooping” open research when reading his article, and had thought about how much publishers can suck sometimes before. That being said, I don’t think the cons outweigh the pros when it comes to sharing research. In regards to academic dishonesty, the fact that your research is posted online shows that you were doing the research first. For publishers, you can avoid those who refuse to publish things that were posted online first. That may be difficult, but it is possible. 

Looking through the websites of the various authors this week, it was interesting to see who had their works and research openly available. Some of them had their research very obviously placed on their website (like Caleb McDaniel and Sheila Brennan) but there were some authors that I couldn’t find anything for. It’s possible that I missed where they link to it. That being said, I find it somewhat ironic that these articles were about sharing research information, but I was unable to find their research information. I would have assumed that they would make it easy to find, since that’s what they are writing about.

I liked Fitzpatrick’s idea of thinking “generously.” As a student, I often feel like when I’m reading something academic I have to find a problem with it. It feels like to engage with a text I have to be “critical” in the literal sense of the word. That combined with our current state of the world, it feels like I should be distrustful of everything. When I took a poetry class in my second year, my professor assigned us to find a book of poetry and review it. He made a point of saying that we couldn’t just criticise it, or sing praises. He wanted us to find a happy medium. This is what I try to strive for when I read things now. I should be somewhat critical of what I’m reading, but I also should look for points that I agree with. Agreeing with something without thought can be problematic, as McDaniel and Owens show that not all academic sources can be trusted to be honest, but refusing to attempt to understand the point of article you’re reading is just as problematic.
