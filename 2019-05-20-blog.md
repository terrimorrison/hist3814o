I laughed a little bit when I realized DH Box was Linux based. My brother is a huge Linux nerd and tried to convert me when I was younger, but I managed to delete the start bar and disable the mouse (thank God for keyboard shortcuts) which left him flabbergasted and then he gave up on me. So I’m a bit concerned about how I’m going to handle this. (I just showed my brother DH Box and he called it “old as beans.”)

I was really confused about the purpose of the $ in the command line prompts, but I figured it was meant to designate the prompts. This was confirmed when I opened my eyes and actually read what was in the workbook. You can see in my todayscommands thing that I copy and pasted the whole command with the $ in it the first time because I wasn’t sure. 

I was also confused by downloading the file. I don’t know where I expected the file to show up, but nothing seemed to happen and I assumed I did it wrong, so I tried again. Nothing happened. Then, the smart part of me decided to reread the instructions, and in doing so, I realized I had to go to the file manager to see the file I just downloaded. Like, makes sense. I’m not sure why I didn’t think to, like, finish the instructions, but I didn’t. So I can confirm that about 99% of my problems are that I’m horrible at following instructions. At the end of the module when I was trying to save the file as html I referred back to the instructions again, but I was confused about where the file actually was until I looked into the folder under my name and say it there. I was very proud when I managed to open my file as html!!

When I was using Nano I had the workbook on one side of my laptop screen and DH Box on the other, and when I typed my little blurb, it appeared like “But I’m d$.” So I briefly thought I broke it until I maximized the screen. DH Box doesn’t like being split screened, I guess. 

I had a lot easier of a time with the third module. I had already played with Github a bit last week, so I was fairly comfortable. I didn’t struggle at all with this portion, even though I’m not entirely comfortable with Github yet. I was able to get this bit done quickly. 

I got confused in the third part of module 4. I’m somewhat proud that I made it that far. DH Box blows my mind. I am just not able to comprehend how to learn how to do this sort of stuff (I understand realistically it’s practice and what not but that’s not my point) because you just start with a blank black screen, type seemingly random things and get cryptic responses and you just… go from there. That being said, I thought the lessons was pretty straight forward until I got stuck. I plan on going back to it once I get some sleep and time to rest my eyes.

So this week I learned that I need to actually pay attention to the instructions. I know that I tend to learn by figuring things out by myself through trial and error, but I need to also learn to follow the instructions first, because they know better than I do. I felt really out of my element when it came to DH Box, so it would have been helpful to have followed the instructions closely before fumbling around and trying to figure it out by myself. It would have saved me time and stress for sure. 

(I tried to make another folder for my module 1 stuff, but it didn’t work. I’ll hopefully figure that out for next week otherwise things will get confusing.)
